# Wiki

The sidebar for wikis is generated automatically from the file structure.

docStatic can automatically link a category to its index document.

A category index document is a document following one of those filename conventions:

* Named as index (case-insensitive): `docs/Guides/index.md`
* Named as README (case-insensitive): `docs/Guides/README.mdx`
* Same name as parent folder: `docs/Guides/Guides.md`
